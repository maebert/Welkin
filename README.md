Ridley SKA and the Fall of Welkin
=================================

Ridley SKA and the Fall of Welkin is a __art-deco ska punk themed zombieploitation puzzle game__, and as such the first and probably only of its kind.

You take the role of Zach Ridley, Skycore Kombine Aviator. Your job is to deliver packets and letters in a world of skattered floating archipelagos, governed by the Skycore Kombine. Unfortunately, a mysterious disease has spread among the world's inhabitants and turned many of them into... mindless... clich√©s. 

Outsmart your enemies in dozens of different mazes - because the mail always goes through!

Welkin is turn-based. That sounds fairly symmetric and symmetrically fair. It's not - for every step you take, your enemies will take two. Fortunately the zombies aren't exactly the smartest french fries in the happy meal (as which they regard you, by the way). They will move to get to you in the most direct way possible, but if their way is blocked, they'll simply stand around and look stupid. Note than often there are two moves which would bring them to you equally fast, if only one is blocked, they'll chose the other one. If they have the choice, they prefer moving southwards, because it's warmer.
